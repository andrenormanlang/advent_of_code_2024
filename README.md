# 🎄 Advent of Code Challenges 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! 🎅✨

In this project, I'm taking on the daily Advent of Code challenges using a variety of programming languages to keep things fresh and learn something new each day. The languages I'm using include:

- 🐍 **Python**
- 📦 **Golang**
- ⚙️ **C# (CSharp)**
- 🟨 **JavaScript**
- 🦀 **Rust**

## 🚀 Running the Solutions

To run the solutions for each day, follow the instructions for the relevant language below.

### 🐍 Python

1. **Navigate** to the relevant Python challenge directory.
2. **Run the script** using Python:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### ⚙️ C# (CSharp)

1. **Navigate** to the C# project directory.
2. **Run the project** using .NET Core (assuming it's a console application):

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

### 📦 Golang

1. **Navigate** to the Go challenge directory.
2. **Run the Go program**:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

### 🟨 JavaScript

1. **Navigate** to the JavaScript challenge directory.
2. **Install dependencies** if necessary:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the script** using Node,  Bun, Deno, PNPM or any other JavaScript runtime:

    ```bash
    node main.js
    ```

    *If you're using PNPM, you can run the script as follows:*

    ```bash
    pnpm run start
    ```

    *If you're using Deno, you can run the script as follows:*

    ```bash
    deno run main.js
    ```

    *If you're using Bun, you can run the script as follows:*

    ```bash
    bun run main.js
    ```

### 🦀 Rust

1. **Navigate** to the Rust challenge directory.
2. **Run the project** using Cargo:

    ```bash
    cargo build

    cargo run
    ```

    *If you're using a single Rust file without Cargo, you can compile and run it as follows:*

    ```bash
    rustc main.rs
    ./main
    ```

## 📜 Additional Information

- Each day's challenge might be implemented in a different language, allowing for a diverse learning experience across various tools and technologies. 🎉
